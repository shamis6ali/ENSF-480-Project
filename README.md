# ENSF-480-Project

To access the database file for this project go to:
Model->Database

From there download the file "SQL File.sql" and then import the database using MySQl Workbench

-----Notes for the Database--------
1. For the Boolean data type I just used int instead of boolean due to SQL issues. In int ; false means 0 and true means 1
2. If you don't want to run queries to view the initial state of the data (i.e. the data which is untouched by any edits you have made), you can use the .csv files
